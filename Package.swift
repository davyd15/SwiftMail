import PackageDescription

// The CLI demos are only built where their dependencies actually compile —
// Apple platforms and Linux — and are dropped from the Windows and Android
// cross-builds:
//   • Windows: swift-dotenv does an unguarded `import Darwin` (no Windows
//     support). The manifest runs on the Windows host here, so `os(Windows)`
//     detects it.
//   • Android: ArgumentParser hits a spurious explicit-module dependency cycle.
//     The skiptools/swift-android-action toolchain sets TARGET_OS_ANDROID=1
//     (the manifest itself runs on the Linux host, so os() can't see Android).
// The SwiftMail library and its tests depend on neither, so they are unaffected.
#if os(Windows)
